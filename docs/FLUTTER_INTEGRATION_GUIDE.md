- Statistics and analytics

## Testing the Integration

### 1. Test Backend Only
```bash
# In the backend directory
python demo_timeout.py
```

### 2. Test API Endpoints
Use the provided cURL commands or a tool like Postman

### 3. Test Flutter App
Run the Flutter app and navigate to the "AI Chat" tab

### 4. End-to-End Test
1. Start the backend server
2. Run the Flutter app
3. Create a user (optional)
4. Ask questions using example questions or custom input
5. View conversation history

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Server not starting**: Check Python dependencies
2. **Flutter build errors**: Run `flutter clean && flutter pub get`
3. **Connection refused**: Ensure backend is running on localhost:5000
4. **Assistant not responding**: Check backend logs for assistant initialization

### Dependencies Required
- Flask, Flask-SQLAlchemy for backend
- speech_recognition, other assistant dependencies
- Flutter http package for API calls

## Next Steps

### Potential Enhancements
1. **Voice Integration**: Add speech-to-text in Flutter
2. **User Authentication**: Add login/signup flow
3. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration
4. **Offline Mode**: Local assistant responses
5. **Push Notifications**: For important assistant responses
6. **Analytics Dashboard**: Usage statistics and insights

This integration provides a solid foundation for AI-powered conversations within your Flutter application!
